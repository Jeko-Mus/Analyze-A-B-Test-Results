# Analyze 3 different Test techniques for an e-commerce company

## Introduction
This project analyses whether or not a company should implement a new company webpage in order to try and increase the number of customers 
who convert and start paying for the company product. If it is found that the new webpage makes no 
difference to whether customers convert or not, it would make sense for the company to keep the old webpage.

The incentive for this training project is in the use of 3 different test types, i.e. probability, A/B tests and regression analysis 
to assist in analysing and advising if a new webpage would be profitable or efficient use of a company's resources.

## Technologies

Python 2.7 or 3.6
